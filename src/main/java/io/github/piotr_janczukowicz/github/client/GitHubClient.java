/**
 * HTTP client for the GitHub REST API. Created by {@link GitHubClients}; the implementation is package-private.
 *
 * <p>Sends the credentials of its {@link AuthenticationProvider}, Accept, User-Agent, API version, and extra headers.
 * The {@code User-Agent} is required and set when the client is created with {@link GitHubClients}: GitHub asks for the
 * name of the application or the GitHub username of its owner so it can make contact when a client causes problems.
 * Configured extra headers cannot replace the credentials; overlay headers on a call replace same-named headers from
 * configuration, including {@code Authorization}.
 *
 * <p>HTTP 2xx become {@link HttpResponse}. Unsuccessful statuses become
 * {@link io.github.piotr_janczukowicz.github.client.exception.GitHubApiException} or a subtype. Transport failures are
 * {@link IOException}.
 *
 * <p>A client made by {@link GitHubClients#create} owns its transport, and {@link #close()} closes it. Every request
 * goes through the always-on stack of {@link GitHubClients}, outermost first: a conditional cache (a repeated GET is
 * sent with its validators, and a 304 is answered from memory), retry (waits out GitHub's rate limits and holds back
 * the other calls of the same credential meanwhile), mutation pacing (one second between mutations by default), a limit
 * on concurrent requests (1 by default, strictly serial as GitHub recommends), then the OkHttp transport. The
 * rate-limit behaviour is described in the <a
 * href="https://github.com/piotr-janczukowicz/github-rest-client/blob/main/README.md#rate-limiting">Rate limiting</a>
 * section of the README.
 *
 * <p><strong>Secondary rate limits.</strong> GitHub limits, besides the hourly quota, at most 100 concurrent requests
 * (enforced by {@link GitHubClients}, which by default sends one request at a time), 900 points per minute per endpoint
 * (GET, HEAD and OPTIONS cost 1 point, writes 5), 90 seconds of CPU time per 60 seconds, and about 80 content-creating
 * requests per minute and 500 per hour; it may apply others without saying so. This interface does not pace requests.
 * The client that {@link GitHubClients} builds does: it delays each mutation by one second unless configured otherwise.
 * The retry layer reacts to a 403 or 429 that signals a limit: it waits as GitHub's documentation requires
 * ({@code Retry-After}, else the reset when no requests remain, else at least 60 seconds, doubling on each repetition),
 * and the gate (see {@link io.github.piotr_janczukowicz.http.transport.RetryingHttpTransport}) holds back the other
 * calls of the same credential meanwhile instead of letting them be rejected too. A program that creates content in
 * bulk must pace itself.
 *
 * <p>Thread safety: a client is safe to share between threads. Its transport stack and rate-limit state are built for
 * concurrent calls, and the {@link AuthenticationProvider} must be safe for concurrent use as well. Create one client
 * per credential and share it instead of creating one per thread or per call: each client has its own connection pool,
 * rate-limit state and conditional cache, so separate clients share none of them.
 *
 * <p>Always call {@link #close()}, for example with try-with-resources. Nothing closes a client for you, and a client
 * that is dropped without {@code close()} keeps its pooled sockets open until the connection keep-alive of
 * {@link io.github.piotr_janczukowicz.http.transport.HttpTransportConfiguration} expires (5 minutes by default), so a
 * program that creates many clients without closing them can run out of file descriptors.
 *
 * <p>A 401 asks the {@link AuthenticationProvider} to drop what it cached
 * ({@link AuthenticationProvider#isRenewableAfterRejection(io.github.piotr_janczukowicz.http.client.authentication.Authentication)});
 * if it does, the call is sent once more with the token it then returns. A base URI that uses plain {@code http} on a
 * host other than loopback is refused when the client is created unless {@link GitHubClientConfiguration} allows it
 * with {@code allowInsecureHttp(true)}.
